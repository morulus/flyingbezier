This repo demonstrates how to move element at a curve with javascript with zero dependencies.

In addition, the element is the image animated via sprites.

This code is little bit dirty, but includes quite working code:
- SVG path to cubicBezier curve converter
- Geometry helpers (finding triangle, circle, etc)
- Curve movement directotion calculations
- Sprtite based animation runner
